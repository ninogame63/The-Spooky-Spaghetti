	<p class="main"> Hi everyone. I'm Nino the creator and the founder of the The Spooky Spaghetti website. The website was founded when I discovered that horror movies is what I like.
	The website itself was created back in 1945. People said it wasn't possible, until I invented time machine. The website have been in development for over 100 years, as it
	was also developed throughout the COVID pandemic. If you need help with the website or wanting to contact my team, the links to our social media is down below! Thank you for visiting.
